# Arduino Repository #

## Contents ##
- *PS2Emu* (PS/2 device and host emulation)
- *SunSerial* (Serial communication with Sun Type 4/5)

## Notes ##
- These libraries and sketches are by no means done! I'm
	keeping them here as I work on them because my blog has seen
	a lot of traffic since I posted this stuff a couple of days
	ago. If you catch a bug or come up with a feature feel free
	to email me at
[mail@danielkudrow.com](mailto:mail@danielkudrow.com "mail@danielkudrow.com") 
	Enjoy!
